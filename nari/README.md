# Nari
Nari is a crate aimed to provide different productivity tools to your application.

It is built with consistency between runs in mind, to achieve this it saves most
of its information in the filesystem, different approaches like using NoSQL/SQL
databases or an entirely in-memory approach may come in the future.
